Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
Mail User Agent (MUA)


Fairly simple as their names suggest


A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission
Agent (MSA) to send its message.
The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server,
commonly hosted on the same server.
The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.

SMTP default protocol 25
POP3 default port 110
