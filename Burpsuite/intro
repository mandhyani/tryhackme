 Various features in Burp

 Proxy. -- It helps intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web apps
 Repeater -- Allows us to capture modify then resent the same request numerous
 times This can help craft a payload in SQLi attacks for trial and Enterprise

 Intruder -- Spray endpoints with requests. used to bruteforce/fuzz endpoints

 Decoder -- Helps encoding/decoding data prior sending it .

 Comparer -- Compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.
 Again this is not something unique to Burp

 Sequencer -- Can be used to assess randomness in data such as session cookie values or other supposedly
 random data generated. If the algo is not generating secure random values, then this could
 open up some devastating avenues for attacks
