There's two kind of recon you can do.

- Passive -- simply you don't interact with the target in this recon
it can be simply utilising OSINT to view publically available knowledge.

 tools - nslookup, dig , tracert/traceroute , host , whois.

 - Active -- Involves sending packets to the target and monitoring its response or a lack of it.
 eg using NMAP
