Nmap OS detection
Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest
OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take
the OS version with a grain of salt.

The -O (capital letter O) helps detect OS.


Nmap scripting engine
A part of Nmap, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a Lua interpreter that allows Nmap to execute Nmap scripts written
in Lua language. However, we donâ€™t need to learn Lua to make use of Nmap scripts.

find scrips in /usr/share/nmap/scripts

--script=default or -sC to use the default scripts
