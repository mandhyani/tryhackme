Unlike In-band SQLi where we can see the results of our attack directly on the screen blind sqli is when we get little to no feedback to confirm whether our injected query was successful or not
This is because the error messages have been disabled, but the injection still works regardless.
All we need is a little bit of feedback to successfully enumerate whole databases

There are two kinds both of which are exploited in kind of the same way.

1. Boolean based sqli
  In case of boolean based SQLi we get response of in binary terms.
  can be true/false 1/0 yes/no on/off etc.
  Now one example of this can be when websites tell us if a username exists or not.
2. Time-Based sqli
  In case of Time-Based SQLi we union a sleep clause with injection attempt which executes
  only when injection was successful.
  The timeout essentially makes this a Boolean based sqli.
