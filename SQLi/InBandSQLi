It's the easiest to detect and exploit

In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also recieve the results.

example discovering a SQL injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.

subsets of In-Band SQLi

-- Error-Based SQLi
When the error messages are returned to the webpages this becomes fairly easy to exploit the whole database.
this type of injection is then called error-based SQLi

-- Union-Based SQLi
this type of injection utilises the SQL union operator along side SELECT statement to return additional results to the page.
The method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQLo vulneranility.
